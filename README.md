## Settings

### Enabled

Self explanatory

### Server IPs


Comma separated list of NGINX cache servers (their IP addresses). They can be publicly accessible addresses or internal IPs (Docker, Kubernentes, MetalLB).

Example:

205.204.88.xx, 178.21.23.xxx, 208.67.222.xxx

Internal:
10.10.10.6, 172.19.0.4

### Additional Domains

## Response

Normal responses are 200 and 412. If you're using GET method with purge path, in case cache is cleared, response status will be 200. If there is nothing to purge, response status will be 412 (NGINX).

## Purge Notice

If notice is not truncated, it will be displayed as this:

| Method       | Counter     | Url     |
| :-------------: | :----------: | ----------- |
|  PURGE | (X)   | http://localhost    |
|  PURGE | (X)   | http://localhost/hello-world    |
|  PURGE | (X)   | http://localhost/hello-world/feed    |

| Method       | Counter     | Url     |
| :-------------: | :----------: | ----------- |
|  GET | (X)   | http://localhost    |
|  GET | (X)   | http://localhost/hello-world    |
|  GET | (X)   | http://localhost/hello-world/feed    |


#### Explanation
* Purge represents PURGE http mehtod. If you're not using PURGE method, then purge path will be used.
* If there is return header set, X will contain number of cleared files. Won't be displayed if there is no response count header 
* URL -> url that has been purged
